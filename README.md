# HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Journey ðŸš€

This repository contains all my projects, code snippets, and experiments as I learn and explore the world of **web development** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Starting from the basics and gradually moving to more advanced topics, I cover everything from simple static web pages to complex layouts, animations, 3D effects, and dynamic functionality.

## What's Inside?

- **Basic HTML**: Simple page structures, headings, lists, tables, forms, and media.
- **CSS Fundamentals**: Styling elements, layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid), colors, typography, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript Basics**: Variables, loops, functions, and DOM manipulation.
- **Advanced CSS**: Animations, transitions, pseudo-classes, and complex selectors.
- **Advanced JavaScript**: ES6 features, event handling, API integration, and more.
- **Cool 3D Effects**: Exploring **3D transforms**, **parallax scrolling**, and creative animations with HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Purpose

The main objective of this repository is to document my learning progress in front-end development and showcase various projects that demonstrate real-world applications of these technologies.
